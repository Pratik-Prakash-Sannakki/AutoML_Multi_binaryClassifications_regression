About the Data

The dataset consists of 7 columns.
species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, or Gentoo)
culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
body_mass_g: body mass (g)
island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago(Antarctica)
sex: penguin sex




Some Terms to know

What are culmen length & depth?
Answer. The culmen is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak".

We find the following 

* Is the relationship significant?

* Are any model assumptions violated?

* Is there any multicollinearity in the model?

* In the multivariate models are predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?

* In in multivariate models rank the most significant predictor variables and exclude insignificant ones from the model.

* Does the model make sense?

* Does regularization help?

* Which independent variables are significant?

* Which hyperparameters are important?
